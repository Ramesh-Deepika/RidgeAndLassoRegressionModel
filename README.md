# Advanced Regression Model
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

 

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.


You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house.
- How well those variables describe the housing price
- The data set that is used in this project is train.csv file 
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We are able to achieve an R2 score of 0.82 approx on both Ridge and Lasso Models. 
The follwing factors influence the house price the most as demosntrated by both the models:-
- Total area in square foot
- Total Garage Area
- Total Rooms
- Overall Condition
- Lot Area
- Centrally Air Conditioned
- Total Porch Area (Open + Enclosed)
- Kitchen Quality
- Basement Quality
